This is a collection of Python based tools that scrape Autolev 4.1 input/output
files and produce simulation, analyses and publication code.

This is a fork of the alparse script written by Dale L. Peterson which has been
heavily modified and extended.

alparse
=======

A python script for parsing the .c and .in files that is generated by Autolev
when a code dynamics() call is made.

The purpose of the parser is to get the essential code from the .c file so that
it may be used in other languages, and to help eliminate the tedious copying
and pasting that is often done when modifying the Autolev code to fit your
needs.

Currently, the goal is to support several types of output code:
1) Psuedo-code
2) Python code
3) C code
4) C++ code

If Python or C++ code output is selected, it is optionally made into a class,
with class member functions for the relevant sections.
